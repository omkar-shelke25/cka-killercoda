# 🧠 CKA: Storage Migration - OpenEBS Local StorageClass

Welcome to this Kubernetes storage management challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll work on migrating storage infrastructure from Rancher's local-path provisioner to OpenEBS local storage. 

You'll create a new StorageClass with specific configuration requirements and manage default StorageClass settings across the cluster.
