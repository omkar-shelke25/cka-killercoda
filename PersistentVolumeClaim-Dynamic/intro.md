# 🧠 CKA: PersistentVolumeClaim with Dynamic Provisioning

Welcome to this Kubernetes storage challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll work with PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and dynamic provisioning to add persistent storage to an existing application Deployment. You'll configure a PVC that uses the Rancher Local Path Provisioner to automatically create a PersistentVolume, then modify a Deployment to mount this storage.

This simulates real-world scenarios where applications need persistent storage that survives pod restarts and rescheduling.

Understanding Kubernetes storage concepts including PVCs, PVs, StorageClasses, and dynamic provisioning is essential for the CKA exam and production Kubernetes environments.
