# 🔒 CKA: Node Taints and Pod Tolerations Configuration

Welcome to the Node Security Challenge! 🛡️

## 📖 The Situation

A worker node `node01` needs to be reserved for secure workloads only. Regular pods should not be scheduled on this node unless they have explicit permission through tolerations.

You need to taint the node to prevent unauthorized scheduling, then create a pod that can tolerate this taint and run on the secured node.
