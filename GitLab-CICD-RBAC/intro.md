# 🧠 CKA: RBAC and ServiceAccount Token Management

Welcome to this Kubernetes RBAC challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll configure Role-Based Access Control for a GitLab CI/CD integration by creating a ClusterRole, binding it to a ServiceAccount, generating a time-limited token, and using that token to interact with the Kubernetes API directly. This simulates real-world CI/CD pipeline authentication patterns where external systems need programmatic access to your cluster.

Understanding RBAC and API authentication is crucial for securing Kubernetes clusters while enabling automation tools to perform their required operations safely.
