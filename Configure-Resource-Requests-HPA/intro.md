# 🧠 CKA: Resource Requests and Limits for HPA

Welcome to this Kubernetes resource management challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll configure resource requests and limits for a Deployment that has an HPA (HorizontalPodAutoscaler) targeting it. 

The HPA is currently stuck in an Unknown state because the Pods lack resource definitions, making it impossible to calculate utilization metrics.
