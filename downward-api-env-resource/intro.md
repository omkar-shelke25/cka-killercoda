# 🧠 CKA: Downward API - Resource Monitoring with Sidecar

Welcome to this Kubernetes Downward API challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll configure a **Pod** with the **Downward API** to expose container resource specifications as environment variables to a sidecar monitoring container.  

The Downward API is a powerful feature that allows containers to consume information about themselves or the cluster without using the Kubernetes API directly.
