# 🧠 CKA: Node Taints and Pod Tolerations

Welcome to this Kubernetes taints and tolerations challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll learn how to control pod scheduling using node taints and pod tolerations. Taints allow nodes to repel pods, while tolerations allow pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

Understanding taints and tolerations is a crucial skill for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam and real-world cluster management.
