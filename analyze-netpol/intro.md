# 🔒 CKA: Analyze and Deploy NetworkPolicy

Welcome to this Kubernetes NetworkPolicy analysis challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll work with **multiple NetworkPolicy YAML files** and need to identify which one correctly implements the required security controls. 

This simulates real-world situations where you must review, understand, and select the appropriate security policies.

Understanding how to read, analyze, and select appropriate NetworkPolicies is crucial for the CKA exam and for implementing proper security controls in production environments.
