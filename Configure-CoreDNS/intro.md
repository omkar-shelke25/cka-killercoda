# 🧠 CKA: CoreDNS Configuration and DNS Resolution

Welcome to this Kubernetes CoreDNS challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll configure CoreDNS to use custom upstream DNS servers, simulating a real-world requirement where clusters need to use specific DNS providers for external name resolution.

You'll modify the CoreDNS ConfigMap to use Google DNS (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) as upstream resolvers, then verify the configuration by performing DNS lookups from a test pod.

Understanding DNS configuration in Kubernetes is crucial for troubleshooting networking issues, ensuring reliable service discovery, and meeting organizational DNS requirements.
