# 🧠 CKA: Create Static Pod on Control Plane

Welcome to this Kubernetes static pod challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll create a **static pod** directly managed by the kubelet on the control plane node. Static pods are different from regular pods because they are managed by the kubelet rather than the API server.
