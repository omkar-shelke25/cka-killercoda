# 🧠 CKA: AlwaysDeny Authorization Mode for Debugging

Welcome to this Kubernetes authorization challenge! 🚀  

In this scenario, you'll work with Kubernetes authorization modes to understand how the API server evaluates authorization decisions. You'll configure the `AlwaysDeny` authorization mode to demonstrate authorization evaluation order and learn how to troubleshoot authorization issues.

This is a critical skill for understanding Kubernetes security architecture, debugging access control problems, and preparing for scenarios where you need to temporarily restrict cluster access for security testing or maintenance.
